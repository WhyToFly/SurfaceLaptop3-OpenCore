# OpenCore config for Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 13.5" (Intel Core i5-1035G7)
Tested with macOS 13.0 Ventura Beta 4

Not working: Audio output on USB-C to HDMI adapter

Otherwise everything (even the touchscreen!) seems to work well thanks to Xiashangning's great [BigSurface](https://github.com/Xiashangning/BigSurface) kext.
